Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you omit
main       - missing Identifiers
String     - missing Identifiers
HelloWorld - missing Identifiers
System.out - missing Symbol
println    - missing Identifiers

Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you omit
the ;         - Syntax error ; expected
the first "   -  ) expected 
the second "  -  unclosed String literal
the first {   - { expected
the second {  - ; expected
the first }   - reached end of file while parsing
the second }  - reached end of file while parsing

Describe what happens if, in HelloWorld.java, you misspell (by, say, omitting the second letter)
main    - main method not found
String  - cannot find symbol
HelloWorld -class HeloWorld is public, should be declared in a file named HeloWorld.java
System.out - package Sysem does not exist
println    -cannot find symbol
            symbol:   method pritln(java.lang.String)
            location: variable out of type java.io.PrintStream  
            

I typed in the following program. It compiles fine, but when I execute it, I get the error java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main. What am I doing wrong?
public class Hello {
   public static void main() {
      System.out.println("Doesn't execute");   
   }
}
Answer: you forgot the String[] args. It is required.

Error reported - Main method not found in class Hello, please define the main method as:
                 public static void main(String[] args)
                 or a JavaFX application class must extend javafx.application.Application
